        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Front-end developer at Facebook. Before that, front-end team leader, front-end developer and back-end
            developer. At Facebook, I focus on adapting the teamâ€™s web product to varying form factors, particularly
            mobile. During the past few years at my previous job, developed a productâ€™s web app from the ground up,
            first as an engineer and later as the team leader.</p>

        <h2>Employment</h2>
        <h3>2018 - present, Front-end developer at Facebook</h3>
        <p>Joined the team responsible for the companyâ€™s internal dashboarding product. Focused on adapting the product
            better to varying form factors, such as small laptop displays and large non-interactive TV screens.
            Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Pitched the idea to develop a web view for mobile devices, the teamâ€™s opinion was that the required
                    effort for an MVP is too big. Built proof of concept as a hackathon project to demonstrate actual
                    effort is smaller, gained team approval for the project, implemented, experimented with the group
                    (team & offshore sister teams) and released.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Introduced CSS grid to the group, assisted engineers to start using it in their products.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mentored an intern to successfully complete their project and receive an offer of employment.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Among the technologies Iâ€™ve used: React including hooks, GraphQL with Relay.</p>

                <p>Autonomous cars. Beyond the obvious coolness, what is it like to be a developer for THAT kind of
